***Website is coming***
This is a one-stop-solution for people who want to deploy their AI models as cost effectively as possible.

five comprehensive design documents cover all aspects of the platform:

- System Architecture: A high-level overview of the entire platform with components, data flows, and implementation approach.
- Model Deployment Pipeline: Detailed design of the pipeline for uploading, optimizing, containerizing, and deploying AI models.
- Infrastructure Management: Design for the Kubernetes-based orchestration, load balancing, resource monitoring, caching, and multi-cloud arbitrage systems.
- Developer Experience: Comprehensive design of the API, SDK, CLI, and web dashboard interfaces to ensure ease of use.
- Monitoring and Analytics: Design for real-time cost analysis, performance metrics, usage analytics, and optimization recommendations.

The architecture focuses on cost optimization through several key strategies:

- Serverless-first approach to minimize idle resource costs
- Multi-cloud arbitrage to utilize the cheapest available resources
- Intelligent resource management with hibernation for inactive models
- Model optimization techniques (quantization, pruning, distillation)
- Cost-aware scheduling and resource allocation
