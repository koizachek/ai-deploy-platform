# ai-deploy-platform
***Website is coming***
This is a one-stop-solution for people who want to deploy their AI models as cost effectively as possible. This repository covers:

# 1. five design documents explaining the platform:

- System Architecture: A high-level overview of the entire platform with components, data flows, and implementation approach.
- Model Deployment Pipeline: Detailed design of the pipeline for uploading, optimizing, containerizing, and deploying AI models.
- Infrastructure Management: Design for the Kubernetes-based orchestration, load balancing, resource monitoring, caching, and multi-cloud arbitrage systems.
- Developer Experience: Comprehensive design of the API, SDK, CLI, and web dashboard interfaces to ensure ease of use.
- Monitoring and Analytics: Design for real-time cost analysis, performance metrics, usage analytics, and optimization recommendations.

# 2. The architecture optimizes cost through:

- Serverless-first approach to minimize idle resource costs
- Multi-cloud arbitrage to utilize the cheapest available resources
- Intelligent resource management with hibernation for inactive models
- Model optimization techniques (quantization, pruning, distillation)
- Cost-aware scheduling and resource allocation

# 3. All coming together in form of:

Command-Line Interface (CLI): Created a comprehensive CLI tool that allows users to manage models, deployments, and analytics from the terminal. The CLI provides commands for uploading models, optimizing them, creating deployments, and viewing cost and performance analytics.


RESTful API: Implemented a complete API using FastAPI that exposes all platform functionality through well-defined endpoints. The API includes routes for model management, deployment operations, and analytics, making it easy to integrate with other systems.


Web Dashboard: Developed an interactive web dashboard using Next.js with Tailwind CSS that provides visual analytics and management capabilities. featuring:


- Cost analysis with comparative charts
- Performance metrics and anomaly detection
- Usage forecasting for capacity planning
- Optimization suggestions with actionable recommendations

# 4. All three interfaces provide consistent access to the platform's core features:

- Model upload, optimization, and management
- Deployment creation and configuration
- Cost optimization settings (spot instances, hibernation, multi-cloud)
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Resource optimization recommendations
