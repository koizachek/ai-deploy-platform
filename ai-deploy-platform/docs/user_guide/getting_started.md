## Introduction

The AI Deploy Platform is designed to be a one-stop solution for deploying AI models as cost-effectively as possible. It provides:

- **Cost Optimization**: Serverless architecture, spot instances, hibernation, and multi-cloud arbitrage
- **Model Deployment**: One-click deployment, optimization pipeline, and auto-scaling
- **Infrastructure Management**: Kubernetes-based orchestration, load balancing, and resource monitoring
- **Developer Experience**: Simple API, SDK, CLI tools, and web dashboard
- **Monitoring and Management**: Real-time cost analysis, performance metrics, and optimization suggestions

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with the AI Deploy Platform, you need to install the CLI tool:

```bash
pip install aideploy
```

### Authentication

Before using the platform, you need to authenticate:

```bash
aideploy auth login
```

This will open a browser window where you can log in to your account.

### Basic Workflow

The typical workflow for using the platform is:

1. Upload your model
2. Optimize the model (optional)
3. Create a deployment
4. Monitor performance and costs
5. Apply optimization suggestions

## Uploading Models

You can upload models in various formats, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNX.

### Using the Web Dashboard

1. Navigate to the "Models" section
2. Click "Upload Model"
3. Fill in the model details and select the model file
4. Click "Upload"

### Using the CLI

```bash
aideploy models upload --name "my-model" --framework "pytorch" --version "1.0" --file "/path/to/model.pt"
```

### Using the API

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.aideploy.example.com/models"
files = {"file": open("/path/to/model.pt", "rb")}
data = {
    "name": "my-model",
    "framework": "pytorch",
    "version": "1.0"
}

response = requests.post(url, files=files, data=data)
model_id = response.json()["model_id"]
```

## Model Optimization

The platform offers several optimization techniques to reduce model size, improve latency, and lower deployment costs.

### Optimization Methods

- **Quantization**: Reduces model precision (e.g., from float32 to int8)
- **Pruning**: Removes unnecessary weights from the model
- **Distillation**: Creates a smaller model that mimics the behavior of a larger model

### Using the Web Dashboard

1. Navigate to the "Models" section
2. Find your model and click "Optimize"
3. Select the optimization method and parameters
4. Click "Start Optimization"

### Using the CLI

```bash
aideploy models optimize --id "model-id" --method "quantization" --target-latency 10.0
```

### Using the API

```python
import requests
import json

url = f"https://api.aideploy.example.com/models/{model_id}/optimize"
data = {
    "method": "quantization",
    "target_latency": 10.0
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
optimized_model_id = response.json()["id"]
```

## Creating Deployments

Once you have uploaded your model, you can create a deployment to make it available for inference.

### Deployment Types

- **Serverless**: Pay-per-use, minimal cold start latency
- **Kubernetes**: For high-throughput, consistent workloads

### Using the Web Dashboard

1. Navigate to the "Deployments" section
2. Click "Create Deployment"
3. Select your model and deployment type
4. Configure resources, scaling, and cost optimization settings
5. Click "Create"

### Using the CLI

```bash
aideploy deployments create --name "my-deployment" --model-id "model-id" --deployment-type "serverless" --cpu 1 --memory 2Gi --min-instances 1 --max-instances 5 --target-cpu 70 --use-spot --enable-hibernation --enable-multi-cloud
```

### Using the API

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://api.aideploy.example.com/deployments"
data = {
    "name": "my-deployment",
    "model_id": "model-id",
    "model_type": "original",
    "deployment_type": "serverless",
    "resource_requirements": {
        "cpu": "1",
        "memory": "2Gi",
        "timeout": 30
    },
    "scaling_policy": {
        "min_instances": 1,
        "max_instances": 5,
        "target_cpu_utilization": 70
    },
    "cost_optimization_policy": {
        "use_spot_instances": True,
        "hibernation_enabled": True,
        "hibernation_idle_timeout": 1800,
        "multi_cloud_enabled": True
    }
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
deployment_id = response.json()["id"]
```

## Cost Optimization Features

The platform includes several features to minimize deployment costs:

### Spot/Preemptible Instances

Spot instances can reduce costs by up to 90% compared to on-demand instances. Enable this feature when creating a deployment:

```bash
aideploy deployments create --use-spot
```

### Hibernation

Hibernation automatically shuts down inactive deployments and restarts them when needed:

```bash
aideploy deployments create --enable-hibernation --hibernation-timeout 1800
```

### Multi-Cloud Arbitrage

The platform can automatically select the cheapest cloud provider for your workload:

```bash
aideploy deployments create --enable-multi-cloud
```

### Storage Tiering

The platform automatically moves infrequently accessed models to cheaper storage tiers.

## Monitoring and Analytics

The platform provides comprehensive monitoring and analytics to help you optimize costs and performance.

### Cost Analysis

View detailed cost breakdowns by deployment, model, and resource type:

```bash
aideploy analytics cost
```

### Performance Metrics

Monitor latency, throughput, and error rates:

```bash
aideploy analytics performance
```

### Usage Forecasting

Predict future usage and costs:

```bash
aideploy analytics forecast --days 30
```

### Optimization Suggestions

Get actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve performance:

```bash
aideploy analytics suggestions
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Deployment Failed

If your deployment fails, check the logs:

```bash
aideploy deployments logs --id "deployment-id"
```

#### High Latency

If your deployment has high latency, consider:

1. Optimizing your model using quantization or pruning
2. Increasing the resources allocated to the deployment
3. Enabling caching for frequent requests

#### High Costs

If your costs are higher than expected, consider:

1. Enabling spot instances
2. Enabling hibernation for inactive deployments
3. Optimizing your model to reduce resource requirements
4. Following the optimization suggestions in the analytics dashboard
