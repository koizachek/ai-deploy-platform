## Cost Optimization Strategies

The infrastructure management system implements several key strategies to minimize costs:

### 1. Dynamic Resource Selection
- Continuously evaluate and select the most cost-effective resource type for each workload
- Consider spot/preemptible instances, reserved instances, and on-demand instances
- Balance cost against reliability requirements

### 2. Workload Consolidation
- Bin-pack multiple models onto shared infrastructure where appropriate
- Identify complementary workloads (e.g., combining CPU-intensive and GPU-intensive models)
- Consolidate related models to reduce overhead

### 3. Intelligent Scaling
- Scale resources based on actual demand rather than static configurations
- Implement predictive scaling to anticipate demand changes
- Use fine-grained scaling to avoid over-provisioning

### 4. Storage Optimization
- Implement tiered storage based on access patterns
- Compress and deduplicate model artifacts
- Automatically archive or delete unused artifacts

### 5. Network Cost Reduction
- Optimize data transfer between components
- Cache results to reduce redundant computations
- Co-locate related services to minimize cross-region traffic

## Integration with Other Components

The infrastructure management system integrates with other platform components:

- **Model Deployment Pipeline**: Receives deployment requests and resource requirements
- **Cost Optimization Engine**: Provides cost data and receives optimization directives
- **Monitoring System**: Supplies resource utilization and performance metrics
- **User Interfaces**: Presents infrastructure status and cost information to users

## Conclusion

The infrastructure management design provides a comprehensive approach to managing the underlying resources of our AI model deployment platform with cost optimization as a primary consideration. By implementing sophisticated scheduling, scaling, and arbitrage mechanisms, the platform can significantly reduce deployment costs while maintaining performance and reliability.
